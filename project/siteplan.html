        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            About Sweet Cheonsa<br>
            <br>
            Meet Sweet Cheonsa, a French artist who embarked on a creative journey that spans continents and
            emotions.<br>
            Born and raised in the picturesque landscapes of France, Sweet Cheonsa recently made her way to the vibrant
            shores of Australia, embracing a new chapter in her artistic career.<br>
            From the tender age of 10, Sweet Cheonsa discovered her love for drawing and the enchanting world of
            creativity.<br>
            Her passion for crafting and bringing her imagination to life was evident from the very beginning.<br>
            She nurtured her skills through a combination of art books, closely observing the work of fellow artists,
            and immersing herself in the captivating narratives of animation movies.<br>
            Music, art, nature, books, and many more have played a profound role in kindling the flames of her
            creativity.<br>
            They served as a constant source of motivation, fueling her desire to create beautiful and meaningful art
            that resonates with the heart and soul.<br>
            Yet, Sweet Cheonsa had to face some challenges that would change here life forever.<br>
            Suddenly, the spark to draw seemed to vanish, leaving her with a profound sense of emptiness.<br>
            For years, she grappled with the darkness created by mental and physical health issues.<br>
            She felt lost and isolated.<br>
            But Sweet Cheonsa's story takes a courageous turn.<br>
            She emerged from this abyss, drawing strength from her own resilience.<br>
            As she resumed her artistic journey, she discovered the capacity to express the deeper, more serious, and
            darker facets of human emotions through her art.<br>
            With a newfound purpose, she sought to confront and communicate the intricate realities of mental and
            physical health issues.<br>
            Today, Sweet Cheonsa continues to wrestle with the ebb and flow of her creative spirit, struggling to draw
            as frequently as her younger self once did.<br>
            However, she remains steadfast in her determination not to abandon her artistic path.<br>
            Looking to the future, Sweet Cheonsa envisions a mission that is twofold.<br>
            She aspires to infuse the world with more light and beauty through her artwork, serving as a beacon of hope
            and inspiration.<br>
            Simultaneously, she is committed to raising awareness of the darker and more challenging aspects of life
            that all of us inevitably encounter.<br>
            In the juxtaposition of light and darkness, Sweet Cheonsa hopes to foster understanding, empathy, and
            healing in a world where art has the power to illuminate and console.<br>
            Sweet Cheonsa's story is one of resilience, determination, and a profound connection to the depths of human
            experience.<br>
            Through her art, she weaves a rich tapestry that invites you to journey with her as she strives to bring
            both beauty and awareness to the canvas of life.
